## Getting things running

1. You need to use node 12 - DO THIS BEFORE YARN INSTALLING
2. There is a `example.env` file - copy it to a `.env` file
3. We've separated the frontend from keystone. To run both now, run
   - `yarn start`
   - in a separate terminal run `yarn start:frontend`

### Database Setup

## TODOs and notes

Look into the dynamic block importer - see if we can simplify this (Mitchell says no)
