it showed black against a silvery climbing phosphorescence that grew and grew. At last,
over the rim of the waiting earth the moon lifted with slow majesty till it swung clear of
the horizon and rode off, free of moorings; and once more they began to see
surfacesâ€”meadows wide-spread, and quiet gardens, and the river itself from bank to bank,
all softly disclosed, all washed clean of mystery and terror, all radiant again as by day,
but with a difference that was tremendous. Their old haunts greeted them again in other
raiment, as if they had slipped away and put on this pure new apparel and come quietly
back, smiling as they shyly waited to see if they would be recognised again under it.`;
